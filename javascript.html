						<p>
							Avoiding inline JavaScript is even more critical than avoiding inline CSS, and for many of the same reasons. This goes for code
							included within <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements, and <strong>double</strong> for things like <code>onClick</code> attributes.
							The former may be permissible in certain circumstances, but the latter never is.
						</p>
						<p>
							A full discussion of this topic can be found 
							<a href="http://robertnyman.com/2008/11/20/why-inline-css-and-javascript-code-is-such-a-bad-thing/" target="_blank" title="Read about why to avoid inline JavaScript">here</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							It should be noted that HTML comments within <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements are no longer necessary. None of the browsers 
							that required this hack are still around, so put this practice to rest. On a related note, the <code>type</code> attribute, 
							required in HTML4, is no longer necessary in HTML5.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>	
						<h2 id="place-external-js">Placement of External JavaScript Files</h2>
						
						<p>
							JavaScript downloads are said to be <em>blocking</em>, because nothing after the JavaScript include in the HTML can be parsed until
							the JavaScript has finished downloading and executing. This can have a huge impact on the performance of a web page, and there are 
							a couple of common ways of dealing with it.
						</p>
							
							<h3 id="end-of-page">Include JavaScript near the end of the page</h3>
							
							<p>
								The most common method of dealing with JavaScript blocking is to include JavaScript at the end of your HTML document, just prior to the 
								closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag. This also helps to ensure that the DOM elements of the page have already been loaded prior to 
								JavaScript execution (so technically, you can omit the event that normally watches for the DOM to be ready, though it's often included
								anyway; this way, if the JavaScript include is moved, things don't break).
							</p>
							<p>
								One of the problems that can arise with this method is you may have code that needs to execute as early as possible in the page rendering
								process. Having some JavaScript included in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the document and some near the bottom of the <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>
								can be bad for maintainability, and can also cause issues if there are dependencies between the two sets of code.
							</p>
							<p>
								When including JavaScript with <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements at the bottom of the page, it is important to minimize the number
								of different JavaScript files being loaded. This becomes less important	when using a script loader.
							</p>
							
							<h3 id="js-loader">Use a JavaScript loader</h3>
							
							<p>
								A recent trend in the web development world is to use a JavaScript loader to bring in all of your external script files. A good script loader
								can end up being the only JavaScript that you include in the traditional fashion, with all other files being called in through the loader's API.
							</p>
							<p>
								Script loaders provide many benefits; they can:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p>
										Load scripts like images, which load separately from the page rendering process (i.e., are non-blocking)
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Provide dependency management, so that scripts can be loaded in parallel, but executed <em>in order</em> (huge performance gains here)
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										Provide callback functions to script loads, ready functions that can execute on a script-by-script basis, and much more
									</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p>
								A comparison of some of the more popular script loaders can be found in this 
								<a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Aqln2akPWiMIdERkY3J2OXdOUVJDTkNSQ2ZsV3hoWVE&amp;hl=en#gid=2" target="_blank" title="Comparison of script loaders">Google spreadsheet</a>.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								<a href="http://headjs.com/" id="head-js" target="_blank" title="Head JS script loader">Head JS</a> is one example that does much of the above, and in addition performs
								many of the duties of a popular script called Modernizr. Head JS acts as a shim for HTML5, so that HTML5 elements will display correctly in 
								Internet Explorer. It appends classes to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element that indicate whether the user's browser supports various CSS3 features
								(and does the same thing for the user's browser and screen size), so that styles can be written accordingly.
							</p>
							<p>
								This page uses Head JS to load most of the page's JavaScript in the fastest way possible (and even allows us to load scripts in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> 
								of the document). 
							</p>
		
							<figure>
								<figcaption class="code-label">Using Head JS looks like this</figcaption>		
								<script class="brush: css" type="syntaxhighlighter">
									<![CDATA[
										&lt;script src="js/head.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
										&lt;script&gt;
											head.js(
												{"WebFont": "http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/webfont/1/webfont.js"}, 		
												{"library": "http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.0/jquery.min.js"},
												{"js/main.js"}
											);
											head.ready("WebFont", function() {
												WebFont.load({
													custom: {
														families: ['SapientSansBoldRegular'],
														urls: ['css/fonts/sapientSansBoldRegular.css']
													}
												});
											});					
										&lt;/script&gt;						]]>
								</script>
							</figure>								
							<p>
								Note that the syntax highlighting JavaScript used on this page is loaded at the bottom of the page with a traditional <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, 
								because even though Head JS was loading and executing the SyntaxHighlighter code in order, the code snippets weren't displaying correctly in Chrome 
								(I suspect that this is due to the organization and compression of the SyntaxHighlighter components). This is a good example of an instance where a blend 
								of the two methods described above was the best approach.
							</p>
					</li>

						<h2 id="use-jquery">Use jQuery</h2>
						<p>
							In depth knowledge of the JavaScript language and the ability to perform common tasks without an AJAX library is strongly 
							encouraged. That said, it isn't realistic or efficient to start from scratch for every project, and JavaScript libraries are 
							invaluable for their ability to simplify common functionality, like DOM manipulation and AJAX requests.
						</p>
						<p>
							There is no such thing as a "best" JavaScript library, but given that jQuery is currently the most popular, it is recommended for use
							in new web pages and applications. This increases the likelihood that other developers will be comfortable working with the code that
							you write.
						</p>
						<p>
							If there is already a different JavaScript framework in place for your project (Mootools, Dojo, YUI3, etc), you should make every
							effort to work within the API provided by that framework and <strong>do not</strong> include jQuery or another such library unless
							it is absolutely necessary to complete your work. AJAX libraries are very similar in terms of the types of functionality they offer, 
							and they are very large in file size. Including more than one is a wasteful use of your users' bandwidth.
						</p>
						<p>
							When including jQuery (or another library), you may want to consider linking to a file on a content delivery network, 
							like the one provided by Google: <a href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.1/jquery.min.js" target="_blank" title="Google CDN version of jQuery">http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.1/jquery.min.js</a>.
							Using a CDN provides a number of benefits: the file usually originates from a server near to the user geographically, will download concurrently with 
							other scripts (because it's coming from a different domain), and often benefits from caching, since multiple web sites all point to the same URI.
						</p>
					</li>	
					<li>
						<h2 id="organize-code">Organize Your Code</h2>
						<p>
							Putting thought into the structure and organization of your JavaScript enables you to write code that
							is easier to maintain, more reusable, easier to read, and less likely to cause collisions with other scripts.
							There are almost as many ways to effectively organize code as there are developers, but several tried and true
							patterns have emerged over the years:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									<a href="http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/3/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-In-Depth" target="_blank" title="Ben Cherry - Module pattern">Module pattern</a>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>

									<a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/2006/02/16/show-love-to-the-object-literal/" target="_blank" title="Chris Heilmann - Object literal">Object literal</a> 
									(basically, the singleton pattern at its simplest)
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Inheritance patterns encourage code reuse and organization; there are several different ways of accomplishing inheritance in JavaScript, but developers are
									encouraged to use one of the following:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p>
											JavaScript is a class-free, prototypal language, but it has sufficient expressive power to simulate a classical system;
											<a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/inheritance.html" target="_blank" title="Douglas Crockford - Pseudo-classical inheritance">Pseudo-classical inheritance</a>
											can be a useful pattern to follow for developers who are familiar with conventional object-oriented languages like C++ and Java
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>
											<a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html" target="_blank" title="Douglas Crockford - Prototypal inheritance">Prototypal inheritance</a> better
											lends itself to the features of the JavaScript language, and is more memory efficient in some situations; Prototypal inheritance is a little strange,
											and may be difficult to get used to if you're used to a conventional object-oriented language
										</p>
										<p>
											An example prototypal inheritance implementation with some helpful utility functions can be found 
											<a href="toolkit/prototypal_inheritance.js" target="_blank" title="Example prototypal inheritance script">here</a>; Note that two of the utility functions are 
											ES5 
											<a href="http://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill/" target="_blank" title="Remy Sharp - Polyfills">polyfills</a>, which are intended to 
											provide ECMAScript 5 functionality in ECMAScript 3 browsers
										</p>

						</ul>
					</li>	
					<li>
						<h2 id="general-js">General Coding Practices</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									Use a code quality tool like <a href="http://www.jslint.com/" target="_blank" title="JSLint">JSLint</a>; JSLint is also integrated into some code authoring 
									tools, such as the Aptana IDE
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Don't use <code>document.write()</code>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Comment your code thoroughly; the use of a standardized documentation format (such as YUI Doc, ScriptDoc, or Natural Docs) is
									recommended
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Declare variables at the top of their containing function
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Don't use 
									<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Reserved_Words" target="_blank" title="MDC - Reserved words">reserved words</a> 
									for variables, functions, or object property names
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Always use <code>var</code> statements when declaring variables, and never use the <code>var</code> statement when assigning
									to a variable that has previously been declared
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									When commenting out code rather than providing documentation, favor single line comments over multi-line comments; 
									Some regular expressions may inadvertently end a multi-line comment, so single line comments are safer
								</p>
								<figure>
									<figcaption class="code-label">Multi-line comment</figcaption>		
									<script class="brush: css" type="syntaxhighlighter">
										<![CDATA[
											/** 
											 *	Multi-line comments should be used for documentation.
											 * 	This format is used by ScriptDoc.
											 * 	@param {String} fooId 	The unique identifier for the foo.
											 * 	@return {Object} 		Returns the current foo.	
											 */
											 function getFoo(fooID){
											 }								]]>
									</script>
								</figure>								
								<figure>
									<figcaption class="code-label">Single line comments</figcaption>		
									<script class="brush: css" type="syntaxhighlighter">
										<![CDATA[
										//	 function getFoo(fooID){
										//	 	console.log("Single line comments should be used to comment out code");
										//	 }								]]>
									</script>
								</figure>								
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Strive to create functions which can be generalized, take parameters, and return values; 
									This allows for substantial code reuse and, when combined with includes or external scripts, 
									can reduce the overhead when scripts need to change 
								</p>
								<p>
									For example, instead of hard coding a pop-window with window size, options, and url, consider 
									creating a function which takes size, url, and options as variables 
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								Minimize the use of global variables (see
								<a class="jumper" href="#organize-code" title="Jump to &quot;Organize Your Code&quot;, below">Organize Your Code</a>, above)
